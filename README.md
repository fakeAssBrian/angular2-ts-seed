## Frequently asked questions

* What's the current browser support for Angular 2 Beta?
  * Please view the updated list of [browser support for Angular 2][27]
* How do I start the app when I get `EACCES` and `EADDRINUSE` errors?
  * The `EADDRINUSE` error means the port `3000` is currently being used and `EACCES` is lack of permission for webpack 
    to build files to `./dist/`
* What are the naming conventions for Angular 2?
  * [Angular 2 Style Guide][30]
* Some dependencies are not met, what's going on?
  * `es6-shim` and `reflect-metadata` are dependencies of angular 2. We decided to include `core-js` as a better replacement.
* What is the `.github` folder for?
  * Read more about it here: [Issue and Pull Request templates][42]. Long story short, it is not a vital part of the 
    project. Feel free to delete it.
